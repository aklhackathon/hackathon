## What are we building?
A Really simple cheat sheet on the web / mobile. It will be fully responsive so the cheat sheet will be available for everyone to use as reference during the game.

## How is this useful?
Because everyone has their own variation of rules to the game. So, to avoid any drunk conflicts mid-game, it's good to set out the basic rules for everyone on the big screen / their own screen before the game has even started.

## Drink responsibly and peacefully.
